      <p>To ensure a level field for all contestants, all code, design, art, music, SFX, and assets must be created during the Hackathon.
         We want to ensure that all participants start off on the same footing and we also want to preserve the true nature of a Hackathon. 
         However, you are free and encouraged to make plans, create wireframes and brainstorm prior to the event. 
         The only exception to this rule includes material that is freely available to the public. 
         You are encouraged to use 3rd party services, APIs, public domain images, creative commons music, open source projects, libraries and frameworks. 
         There is no need to break DRY rules, when there are so many great resources available to all Hackers.
         We take this rule very seriously for the sake of all members attending the event. Failure to comply may result in the disqualification of the offending team. 
        If your team qualifies for prizes, you could be subject to a code review to verify that there was no foul play.</p>
